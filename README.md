# ArgoExplorer

ArgoExplorer is a simple yet powerful module designed for the OpenArgo platform. This board is specifically built to interface with a standard half-height breadboard, making it an excellent starting point for experimenting with custom modules or expanding the platform's capabilities. It includes an integrated debugger, which can be used to program and debug other OpenArgo modules, streamlining development workflows.

## Features
- **Breadboard Compatibility**: Designed to fit snugly on a half-height breadboard, allowing for easy prototyping and testing of circuits.
- **Built-in Debugger**: Includes an onboard debugger that supports programming other OpenArgo modules, providing a seamless way to iterate and improve your designs.
- **Customizable**: Serves as a flexible launch point for integrating your own custom electronics, sensors, or additional components, making it an ideal tool for rapid prototyping.
- **Open-Source Hardware**: Like all OpenArgo modules, ArgoExplorer is fully open-source. You can modify, distribute, and improve the design to suit your project needs.

## Schematic and PCB Design
The KiCAD project files include:
- **Schematic**: Explore the ArgoExplorer circuitry and customize it as needed.
- **PCB Layout**: Optimized for a half-height breadboard, the layout provides efficient space utilization for prototyping.
- **BOM (Bill of Materials)**: A detailed list of all components used, complete with part numbers for easy sourcing.

## Debugger Instructions
The onboard debugger can be used to flash firmware to other OpenArgo modules. To use the debugger:
1. Connect the ArgoExplorer to the module you want to program via the debug header.
2. Follow the instructions in the [OpenArgo debugger documentation](www.OpenArgo.com/debugger).
